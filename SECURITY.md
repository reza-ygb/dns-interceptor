## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue in DNS Interceptor, please follow responsible disclosure:

### 🔒 How to Report

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. Email us at: security@example.com
3. Include detailed information:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

### 📋 What to Include

- **Environment**: OS, Python version, DNS Interceptor version
- **Reproduction Steps**: Clear, step-by-step instructions
- **Expected vs Actual Behavior**
- **Security Impact**: Potential risks and exploitation scenarios
- **Proof of Concept**: Code or commands that demonstrate the issue

### ⏰ Response Timeline

- **24 hours**: Initial acknowledgment
- **72 hours**: Initial assessment and severity rating
- **30 days**: Target fix and release (for high/critical issues)

### 🏆 Recognition

Security researchers who report valid vulnerabilities will be:
- Credited in release notes (if desired)
- Added to our security hall of fame
- Eligible for bug bounty rewards (when program launches)

## Security Best Practices

### For Users
- Always run with minimal required privileges
- Keep DNS Interceptor updated to latest version
- Use only on networks you own or have explicit permission
- Follow ethical hacking guidelines
- Regularly review logs for anomalous activity

### For Developers
- Run security tests before commits
- Use static analysis tools
- Follow secure coding practices
- Validate all user inputs
- Implement proper error handling

## Known Security Considerations

### Network Operations
- Requires root privileges for raw socket access
- ARP spoofing can disrupt network operations
- Mass attack mode can cause network instability
- Always restore network state on termination

### Data Handling
- Captured credentials stored in plain text
- PCAP files may contain sensitive information
- Memory cache includes personal data
- Use secure storage and transmission

### Legal Compliance
- Obtain written authorization before testing
- Comply with local privacy laws
- Follow responsible disclosure policies
- Document testing activities

## Threat Model

### In Scope
- Code injection vulnerabilities
- Privilege escalation issues
- Data exposure concerns
- Network protocol weaknesses
- Authentication/authorization bypasses

### Out of Scope
- Physical security issues
- Social engineering attacks
- Third-party dependency vulnerabilities (unless directly exploitable)
- DoS attacks against the tool itself
- Issues requiring physical access to target systems

## Updates and Patches

Security updates will be:
- Released as priority patches
- Documented in CHANGELOG.md
- Announced via GitHub releases
- Communicated to users via email (if subscribed)
